I've devised calculations based on certain stats of the character and the opponent. The difference between the character's dexterity and the opponent's agility determines the likelihood of landing a critical hit, while the difference between the character's charisma and the opponent's wisdom sets the value of 'x' in the function that dictates the probability of a double strike.
