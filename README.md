This is an unfinished 2D RPG Game. I'm still working on slowly but take a look:

I've devised calculations based on certain stats of the character and the opponent. The difference between the character's dexterity and the opponent's agility determines the likelihood of landing a critical hit, while the difference between the character's charisma and the opponent's wisdom sets the value of 'x' in the function that dictates the probability of a double strike.

Iâ€™ve developed three distinct yet similar functions, all dependent on the value of x, and plotted them on a graph for analysis. The graph is drawn in two different ranges: from 0 to 105 and from 0 to 50, allowing for a more detailed examination. The green line corresponds to a value of 1, indicating a certain outcome, while the purple line represents a value of 0.5, signifying a 50% probability. Among these functions, I chose the one defined as f(x) = 1 - e^(-x/50).
